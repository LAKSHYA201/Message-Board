I am on the free plan of Render (lol), so after 15 mins of inactivity the web app gets spun down to conserve their resources. So trying to access the link after that makes Render rebuild, redeploy the whole app again 
that's why it might take some time to open the app. 

Kindly bear with it pls xD

i have also added the DB functionality that means the messages are not stored in array anymore ,they are stored in postgresql , but they are in my local machine tsk tsk ,cuz render wont allow the DB in free tsk tsk

Pics in case website doesnt load :-
